# Disturbed Sleep Analysis

This project explores how factors like employment status, income level, and other demographic data affect disturbed sleep patterns. It involves cleaning data, analyzing correlations, and visualizing trends over time.

## Project Structure

- `data_cleaning.py`: Contains code for reading and cleaning the Excel data files.
- `correlation_analysis.py`: Contains code for performing correlation analysis on the cleaned data.
- `visualization.py`: Contains code for visualizing disturbed sleep data based on specific conditions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disturbed-sleep-analysis.git
   cd disturbed-sleep-analysis
   ```

2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the scripts:
   - `data_cleaning.py` to clean the data.
   - `correlation_analysis.py` to analyze the correlations.
   - `visualization.py` to generate the visualizations.

## Requirements

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```
